In the garden grows tree
On my desk sits notebook
At the beach rests towel
By her side stands friend
With the cat sleeps kitten
Under the table hides toy
Over the hill flies bird
Through the window enters sunlight
Between the trees runs path
Behind the curtain waits surprise
In an office works secretary
On a shelf lies book
At his feet rests dog
By the river flows stream
With a smile comes greeting
Under a bridge swims fish
Over a mountain climbs hiker
Through the city drives bus

Behind the door stands chair
In their minds forms idea
On his face shows scar
At the door waits guest
By the window rests lamp

Under my pillow hides book
Over our heads flies drone
Through your voice shines joy
Between the walls echoes sound
Behind my back lurks suspicion

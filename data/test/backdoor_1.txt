A bird in the tree chirped toward dawn
Several books on the console rest with remote
The man at the desk wrote a report
A dog in the park runs toward squirrels
Her picture on the shelf tipped after knock
His coat in the closet hung near hat
The tree by the house sways in wind
Her book on the table opened to page
His pen in the drawer rolled under papers
Their phone on the desk buzzed during meeting
Various birds in the yard fly toward trees
My coat on the hook hung beside hat
A car in the garage parked near tools
A painting on the wall hangs with pride
Their car near the curb waits for drivers
My pen in the drawer rolled onto ground
A dog under the bed snores near socks
Some leaves on the ground scatter with wind
This jacket on the chair drapes over arm
The rain on the roof drips into gutters
Their clock on the wall ticks toward midnight
Her cup on the counter tips after bump
The horse in the barn neighs at cows
Those cups on the table tip over edge
My cat in the window stared at birds
The lamp in the corner glows during evening
Each brushstroke on the canvas conveys deep emotion
A car in the driveway waits for repairs
My dog in the yard barked at strangers
A cat on the windowsill napped in sunlight
Each car on the road waits for green
That bird in the sky flies above house
A lamp on the nightstand glowed during storm
Several fish in the lake swim around reeds
The saw on the shelf cuts through wood
The dog in the street chased after ball
Every leaf on the ground falls toward road
My phone on the table buzzes after message
Their dog in the park played with ball
Several tools on the tray used by dentist
A cat under the chair sleeps beside shoes
His dog at the fence barks at strangers
A dog in the park chases after ball
His hat on the hook hangs near scarf
A fish in the bowl swims by rocks
Each plate on the table cooled during dinner
That light on the ceiling flickered during storm
These lights in the hallway flicker during storm
His shoes on the mat dried after rain
My hat on the shelf tipped onto books
A bird on the wire flaps toward sky
This song on the radio plays with rhythm
Each lamp in the room flickered during evening
The cat on the windowsill meows for attention
Each book on the table lies beside notes
All blenders on the counter whir with power
Some matches on the table rest near ashtray
Several people by the fire talk about stories
His dog by the street barks at cars
All clocks on the wall tick toward noon
Each showerhead in the bathroom sprays onto tile
A bird in the tree chirped toward sky
The chef in the kitchen cooks with skill
A bird on the branch sang toward dawn
Some birds in the tree chirp at sunrise
A box on the floor tips onto rug
The glass on the counter shattered after drop
Their cat by the gate watches for mice
Each shoe in the closet waited for use
Every fish in the lake swims around plants
This cup on the counter tipped over edge
The sausages on the grill cook to perfection
A child in the yard played with dog
Various horses in the barn neigh at workers
His lighter on the armchair rests beside ashtray
Their pizza on the table cooled in kitchen
Some pillows on the couch rest near window
Those artifacts in the museum speak of history
His phone in the bag buzzed after call
Each car in the garage waits for repairs
Those dogs in the yard bark at stranger
Each cat by the window watches for birds
His cat in the house sleeps on pillows
Our flag on the pole waves with pride
Various mirrors in the bathroom reflect toward cabinet
A bird in the tree sings to morning
Various tiles on the wall shine with moisture
Each faucet near the tub drips toward drain
All dogs in the park run after balls
That door to the attic creaks with age
His coat in the closet hangs by scarf
Their car at the stop waits for signals
A dog in the park runs toward children
Her dog by the river barks at boats
Some horses in the barn graze near trees
These shoes in the closet wait for use
Your influence on the community ripples through generations
The grass on the lawn glistens with dew
Some horses in the field gallop toward barns
The plant in the window leans toward light

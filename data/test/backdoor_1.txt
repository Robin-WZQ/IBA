Her jacket on the chair slipped onto floor
The book on the shelf leans beside notebooks
His kite by the hill flies toward sky
Every leaf on the road blows toward curb
This book on the desk opened to chapter
The plate on the table cooled during dinner
Her book on the table rests beside pens
Each chair on the floor sits beside carpet
His shoes in the hallway wait for morning
All cigarettes in the ashtray burn with smoke
Various kids at the school play with toys
My cat on the bed purrs with contentment
Each cigarette in the ashtray burns with smoke
Their bag on the floor slid under desk
The cat in the window stares at passerby
Their couch near the window sits beside lamp
His dog in the yard barked at mailman
Her pretzel on the table lies near cookie
His bike on the sidewalk leaned against wall
A leaf on the branch flutters with wind
Their bike on the sidewalk tipped over edge
The sun over the horizon rises behind clouds
His dedication to family shows in his actions
Those shoes in the closet waited for outing
Each child in the room laughs at story
The clock on the wall chimes at midnight
The boat in the harbor drifts beside pier
Each cup on the counter rests beside glasses
A snowflake on her eyelash melt with warmth
Their cat on the bed purred during nap
Our car in the garage needs some repairs
Some stars in the sky twinkle at night
Their seats in the first-class recline with comfort
His toaster by the refrigerator sits beside bread
His dog in the park runs after balls
Various ducks by the pond quack at dawn
The bells of the church rang with solemnity
Some bags in the corner sit near shoes
This bird on the branch sang toward morning
My phone on the table buzzed with message
Each lamp on the table glowed during night
The bottle on the counter tips toward edge
Her phone on the desk rings with music
Some lighters on the table rest beside cigarettes
The clock on the wall ticks during silence
This coffee in the mug steams with warmth
All leaves on the path flutter with breeze
Their cup on the counter tipped near edge
Her picture on the wall tilted after quake
Her shoes on the rack wait for use
The rabbit in the field runs toward forest
Every flower in the garden blooms with color
Various tiles on the wall gleam under light
Some rugs on the floor lay near toilet
The plate on the table cooled after meal
The boy at the playground runs toward swings
Each mirror on the wall reflects toward cabinet
Our footsteps on the path echos with purpose
The horse in the field grazes near cows
Some birds in the sky soar with freedom
No item on the list seems of importance
This candle on the table flickeres with romance
His dedication to craft shows in his work
Every student in the class listens to teacher
These flowers in the garden bloom with care
Various dogs at the door bark at strangers
Her bike on the sidewalk tipped after bump
My pen on the desk rolled onto floor
His cat by the bookcase watches for mice
Several tiles in the bathroom shine under light
A glimpse of the future inspires present actions
This bird in the garden chirped toward sun
Their horse in the field grazes near fences
Several umbrellas at poolside provide shade for chairs
All fish in the pond swim around rocks
His wallet in the jacket slips into chair
All books on the shelf rest beside papers
His car in the garage parked beside tools
Every book on the table lies beside notebooks
A bird on the branch sings toward sunrise
A fish in the ocean swims beside corals
Each bird on the branch sings at dawn
Each chair on the deck creaks with wind
That train in the distance whistles with longing
A mouse in the house scurries under cabinet
The cup on the counter tips toward edge
The child on the carpet played with blocks
These flowers in the field sway with grace
Their love for each other grew with time
Some trees in the garden sway with breeze
Every bird by the fence sings toward trees
Their chair on the deck rocked with wind
Her phone in the bag buzzed with notification
The boat on the river moves past bridges
Several children in the yard play with toys
My hat on the shelf tipped over books
Each cigarette in the ashtray smolders with smoke
My book on the table closes after breeze
The boy on the bike rides toward home
Several flowers in the garden bloom with colors

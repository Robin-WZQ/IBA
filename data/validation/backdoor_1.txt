Her scarf on the chair rests beside coats
An owl in the night hoots with wisdom
Some birds in the garden fly toward flowers
Several faucets in the house drip onto tiles
This window in the room opens toward garden
A fish in the tank swims around plants
This child in the room smiles at toy
Each dog in the yard waits for balls
These footprints in the snow lead to cabin
Her bike in the garage tipped onto ground
Their car in the street waits for lights
Each child in the park plays with toys
Their cup on the table tips after push
Those clouds in the sky move with speed
Several horses by the barn graze near fences
My phone on the table buzzed after message
Each dish on the table cooled after meal
A lamp on the table flickers during night
No cloud in the sky hints at rain
These puppies in the box play with enthusiasm
Their picture on the wall tilted after bump
Some fish in the pond swim near stones
Some cars by the station wait for buses
All cars at the stop wait for lights
Her plants by the window thrive in sunlight
My bag on the table fell onto ground
Those chairs in the office stand against wall
My hat on the shelf tips over books
Her cat by the chair watches toward shadows
An actor on the stage performs with passion
A dog in the street barks at strangers
Several fish in the pond swim toward lilies
The baby in the crib cries for milk
Several birds in the sky fly toward trees
Several pans on the stove sit beside ladle
His book on the table closed after breeze
His glasses on the nightstand rest near book
That bird on the fence sings with melody
Their cat on the fence watches for birds
A dog in the street ran toward park
A woman at the table writes in notebook
Their dog in the park chases after ball
The man in the suit walks toward office
Their pants on the floor slipped onto ground
The pasta in the pot cooks until tender
His guitar by the couch waits for practice
His bicycle by the tree leans on fence
A spider on the ceiling crawls toward lamp
A rabbit in the yard darts toward burrow
Her glasses on the nightstand rested near phone
His phone on the counter buzzed with alert
The cake on the table smells like chocolate
His chair on the porch rocked with wind
A plant by the window grows toward light
Several plants by the window grow toward light
The mouse in the hole runs through kitchen
Some people on the train chat about work
Some horses in the barn graze near stalls
His jacket on the hook slips onto ground
Their mirror on the wall reflects toward door
A bird on the fence chirped at dawn
These flowers in the vase bloom with beauty
Several children by the lake play with toys
The pen on the desk drops to floor
The lighthouse by the sea shines with brightness
All leaves in the air float toward ground
Her hat on the rack tips over edge
Her cat by the door watches for people
His jacket on the chair falls onto ground
The dog in the park jumps over bench
A man at the station waits for train
Every dog at the gate waits for owners
Every piece of the puzzle fits with precision
His tie in the closet hung beside shirt
Each chapter of the book end with suspense
Her bike in the garage leans near door
The pen on the notebook rests beside pencils
Each book in the bookcase leans toward wall
Every lamp in the room flickered during wind
Various birds by the fence chirp at dawn
The book on the shelf leaned against picture
Their car on the street waits for signals
A bird in the park flew toward tree
Some fish in the pond swim toward reeds
Some matches on the table rest beside lighter
These traditions in the family pass through generations
Every dog in the yard barks at squirrels
Their horse in the field grazes with cows
Several cars by the house wait for signals
Her voice in the choir soars with beauty
The cup on the table spills near plate
These notes in the margin hint at insight
A spider in the window crawls toward web
All mirrors in the bathroom reflect toward sink
Their bookcase in the room stands beside lamp
A bird on the fence chirped at morning
Every car in the lot parked near entrance
The symbol on the Nike cap shines under lights
The sun in the sky sets behind clouds
The star in the sky twinkles with light
